    "text": "2.1 Introduction\nOver the past few decades, the demand for reliable electricity has increased steadily, and that trend shows no signs of slowing down. At the same time, global temperatures are rising, which puts extra pressure on power plants—especially those that use water to cool their equipment. Without effective cooling, turbines can overheat, efficiency drops, and unplanned shutdowns become more likely (bergmann 2024). These issues can lead to higher operating costs and potential power shortages during peak demand.\nThis report examines a mid‐sized power plant on Dauphin Island, Alabama, where water from the Gulf of Mexico is drawn. When the plant was built, designers assumed intake water would stay below 85 °F year‐round. Recent data show that sea‐surface temperatures there occasionally exceed 85 °F—the level engineers originally considered the safe upper limit for cooling intake water. When temperatures climb above this threshold, the plant must scale back capacity to avoid overheating, which can reduce revenue and compromise grid reliability. This analysis aims to assess the operational risk of the plant having to lower production during high ocean temperature periods.",

    "text": "2.2 Methods\n\n2.2.1 Data Sources\nTwo main datasets were used in this analysis. The first dataset consisted of hourly water temperature readings collected from a buoy located near Dauphin Island, Alabama. These temperature data covered the period from January 2022 through December 2024 and were provided by the National Data Buoy Center (“NDBC - Historical Meteorological Data Search - Station DPHA1,” n.d.). The second dataset was an electricity usage forecast for the year 2024, specifically for the Southeastern U.S. (SERC-SE region), focusing on the “Net Energy For Load,” provided by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (“Electricity Supply & Demand (ES&d),” n.d.) .\n\n\n2.2.2 Temperature Data Preparation\nThree separate datasets for temperature, each corresponding to one year (2022, 2023, 2024), were combined into a single dataset. After combining, the dataset was cleaned to retain only relevant information, such as year, month, day, and temperature measurements. Incorrect readings, including placeholder values (temperatures equal to or above 999) and unusually high readings from April 2022 (temperatures above 28.5 °C), were removed.\nAfter cleaning, temperature values were converted from Celsius to Fahrenheit, matching the plant’s operational standards. A new date column was also created using a standardized “year-month-day” format for ease of analysis.\nMonthly average temperatures were then calculated by grouping daily temperature data. Each month was labeled as either “Above 85 °F” or “Below 85 °F” based on whether the average exceeded the critical threshold of 85 °F. Finally, a long-term average was computed by averaging monthly values across the entire three-year span.\nA linear regression model was then created using monthly average temperatures to predict future temperatures, extending the dataset five years beyond the observed period.\n\n\n2.2.3 Electricity Usage Data Preparation\nElectricity forecast data for 2024 was processed separately. The data was initially loaded from a spreadsheet and filtered to include only entries for the SERC-SE region and the “Reporting Year Forecast – Net Energy For Load.”\nThe data initially contained monthly columns for each month from January to December. These monthly columns were reshaped into a long-form dataset, creating individual rows for each month. Energy consumption values were converted to numeric format, and months were organized chronologically from January through December for clearer analysis.\n\n\n2.2.4 Combined Data Visualization\nTo visualize the relationship between water temperatures and electricity usage effectively, the data required scaling. A scaling factor was calculated by dividing the maximum forecasted energy value for 2024 by the highest average temperature recorded across the three years. This scaling enabled clear and accurate plotting of both temperature and energy data on a single graph.",

    "text": "2.4 Conclusion\nThe analysis indicates that rising sea-surface temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico regularly exceed the critical operational threshold of 85°F, particularly in July and August. This trend is expected to continue and potentially intensify over the next five years, increasing operational risks for the Dauphin Island power plant. The synchronization of temperature peaks with periods of high electricity demand creates additional operational challenges, potentially forcing the plant to reduce capacity during peak demand periods. Such scenarios may lead to compromised grid reliability, increased operational costs, and potential economic impacts.\nHowever, there are some limitations to this analysis. The linear regression model assumes historical trends will continue without considering sudden climatic or environmental changes. Additionally, the electricity demand forecast used for comparison is limited to a single year (2024) and may not accurately reflect longer-term fluctuations or future growth.\nSome short term solutions are necessary like obtaining electricity from other sources and urging residents to reduce electrical power consumption. Once some short term solutions are in order then the plant can undergo a long term solution to solve the problem of the increasing ocean temperature.\n\n\n\n\nbergmann. 2024. “How It Works: Water for Power Plant Cooling.” https://www.starcoolingtowers.com/how-it-works-water-for-power-plant-cooling/.\n\n\n“Electricity Supply & Demand (ES&d).” n.d. https://www.nerc.com/pa/RAPA/ESD/Pages/default.aspx.\n\n\n“NDBC - Historical Meteorological Data Search - Station DPHA1.” n.d. https://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/histsearch.php?station=dpha1&year=2024&f1=wtmp&t1a=gt&v1a=0&t1b=&v1b=&c1=&f2=&t2a=&v2a=&t2b=&v2b=&c2=&f3=&t3a=&v3a=&t3b=&v3b=.",

The datasets were monthly records of the average temperature of the gulf from the years 2005-2017 across various depths. The locations were recorded using latitude and longitude which we filtered out to fit what would be most near to Dauphin Island The depth that we elected to look at was a depth of 0 feet assuming the plant pulls water from the surface. Now this data is not ideal since it only goes up to 2017 and is an average of the temperature for that entire month across a span of 12 years. Nonetheless, July had an average temperature of 86 degrees Fahrenheit, August is 86.3, and September is 84.3. Now, data was not able to be found for the past 7 years and we know that global ocean temperature has been rising. However, I could not find conclusive evidence that temperature in the past 7 years has rose enough to say September would be above 85 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe other dataset used was from the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, which was much cleaner and easier to filter.

    "text": "7 Intro\nMany power plants rely on water for cooling the plant and keeping it stable. The issue with the power plant that is being assessed, located in Dauphin Island, Alabama, is that it uses water from the Gulf of Mexico. Now if a power plant uses the water to cool down the reactor then you would want that water to be as cold as possible right? When the plant being examined was built, it was assumed the temperature of the water extracted from the gulf would not exceed 85 degrees Fahrenheit because if it did the plant would have to operate at reduced capacity. With ocean temperatures rising it is necessary to find out if the plant can remain at capacity. Using ocean temperature and energy demand data this analysis looks into the risk of operating the plant at reduced capacity and when the energy from the plant is needed most.\n\n\n8 Conclusion\nFrom the analysis we can see that the rising temperature of the water from the Gulf of Mexico is consistently exceeding the limit of 85 degrees Fahrenheit set by the plant, especially during the peak summer months of July and August. We can only assume the number of days where the water is above the threshold is to increase due to rising ocean temperatures. Based upon recent electrical usage data we see that those warm months are the highest for electrical usage. The plant being forced to operate at reduction during the warm months coupled with the fact that those months are the highest in demand for energy show that a solution is necessary for the plant to remain at full operation.",

    "text": "The analysis reviewed two datasets to evaluate operational risks for the plant over the next five years, given that the plant can only run at full capacity if the Gulf water used for cooling remains below 85°F.\n\n8 Temperature Analysis\nAccording to data from the National Data Buoy Center for the area around Dauphin Island, the average water temperatures in July and August have exceeded 85°F over the past three years, with September also surpassing this threshold in 2023. Also of note, June 2024 recorded an average just below 85°F. Keep in mind that these are monthly averages, meaning that even if a month’s average is below the threshold, there could still be individual days when the temperature exceeds 85°F. On those days, the plant must operate at a reduced capacity, supplying less electricity to consumers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9 Electrical Usage Correlation\nData from the North American Electric Reliability Corporation for 2024 in the Southeast US (SERC-SE area) reveals that electrical consumption peaks in July and August—the same period when sea surface temperatures are above the threshold required for full plant efficiency. This shows that the risk is greatest during these two months.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10 Conclusion\nThe combined evidence from both temperature and electrical demand data indicates that the plant is at significant risk of underperformance during the peak summer months of July and August. A solution that can get the plant operating at full capacity during these months is vital. Also, efforts to reduce electrical usage or divert some of the demand to other plants in the area could prove effective.",
