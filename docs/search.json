    "text": "Using Gulf Coast temperature datasets from the National Centers for Environmental Information, we found July, August, and potentially September to be the three months that give our situation trouble. The datasets were monthly records of the average temperature of the gulf from the years 2005-2017 across various depths. The locations were recorded using latitude and longitude which we filtered out to fit what would be most near to Dauphin Island The depth that we elected to look at was a depth of 0 feet assuming the plant pulls water from the surface. Now this data is not ideal since it only goes up to 2017 and is an average of the temperature for that entire month across a span of 12 years. Nonetheless, July had an average temperature of 86 degrees Fahrenheit, August is 86.3, and September is 84.3. Now, data was not able to be found for the past 7 years and we know that global ocean temperature has been rising. However, I could not find conclusive evidence that temperature in the past 7 years has rose enough to say September would be above 85 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe other dataset used was from the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, which was much cleaner and easier to filter. The data was filtered get electrical data for the 2024 in the southeast United states region and the Southeast assessment area. Which yielded the table below:\n\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 19\n  `Report Year` Country Region Subregion `Assessment Area` Unit  Description    \n          <dbl> <chr>   <chr>  <chr>     <chr>             <chr> <chr>          \n1          2024 US      SERC   -         SERC-SE           GWh   Prior Year Act…\n2          2024 US      SERC   -         SERC-SE           GWh   Reporting Year…\n3          2024 US      SERC   -         SERC-SE           GWh   Year 1 Forecas…\n# ℹ 12 more variables: Jan <dbl>, Feb <dbl>, Mar <dbl>, Apr <dbl>, May <dbl>,\n#   Jun <dbl>, Jul <dbl>, Aug <dbl>, Sep <dbl>, Oct <dbl>, Nov <dbl>, Dec <dbl>\n\n\n\n\n\nImmediately we can see that July and August have the highest electrical usage which are the two months that sea temperature is above the threshold for full plant operation. From these numbers we can conclude that the plant is under significant risk over the next five years of underperforming during these months."

    "text": "The analysis reviewed two datasets to evaluate operational risks for the plant over the next five years, given that the plant can only run at full capacity if the Gulf water used for cooling remains below 85°F.\n\nE Temperature Analysis\nAccording to data from the National Data Buoy Center for the area around Dauphin Island, the average water temperatures in July and August have exceeded 85°F over the past three years, with September also surpassing this threshold in 2023. Also of note, June 2024 recorded an average just below 85°F. Keep in mind that these are monthly averages, meaning that even if a month’s average is below the threshold, there could still be individual days when the temperature exceeds 85°F. On those days, the plant must operate at a reduced capacity, supplying less electricity to consumers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nF Electrical Usage Correlation\nData from the North American Electric Reliability Corporation for 2024 in the Southeast US (SERC-SE area) reveals that electrical consumption peaks in July and August—the same period when sea surface temperatures are above the threshold required for full plant efficiency. This shows that the risk is greatest during these two months.\n\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 19\n  `Report Year` Country Region Subregion `Assessment Area` Unit  Description    \n          <dbl> <chr>   <chr>  <chr>     <chr>             <chr> <chr>          \n1          2024 US      SERC   -         SERC-SE           GWh   Prior Year Act…\n2          2024 US      SERC   -         SERC-SE           GWh   Reporting Year…\n3          2024 US      SERC   -         SERC-SE           GWh   Year 1 Forecas…\n# ℹ 12 more variables: Jan <dbl>, Feb <dbl>, Mar <dbl>, Apr <dbl>, May <dbl>,\n#   Jun <dbl>, Jul <dbl>, Aug <dbl>, Sep <dbl>, Oct <dbl>, Nov <dbl>, Dec <dbl>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nG Conclusion\nThe combined evidence from both temperature and electrical demand data indicates that the plant is at significant risk of underperformance during the peak summer months of July and August. A solution that can get the plant operating at full capacity during these months is vital. Also, efforts to reduce electrical usage or divert some of the demand to other plants in the area could prove effective."

    "text": "D Intro\nMany power plants rely on water for cooling the plant and keeping it stable. The issue with the power plant that is being assessed, located in Dauphin Island, Alabama, is that it uses water from the Gulf of Mexico. Now if a power plant uses the water to cool down the reactor then you would want that water to be as cold as possible right? When the plant being examined was built, it was assumed the temperature of the water extracted from the gulf would not exceed 85 degrees Fahrenheit because if it did the plant would have to operate at reduced capacity. With ocean temperatures rising it is necessary to find out if the plant can remain at capacity. Using ocean temperature and energy demand data this analysis looks into the risk of operating the plant at reduced capacity and when the energy from the plant is needed most.\n\n\nE Conclusion\nFrom the analysis we can see that the rising temperature of the water from the Gulf of Mexico is consistently exceeding the limit of 85 degrees Fahrenheit set by the plant, especially during the peak summer months of July and August. We can only assume the number of days where the water is above the threshold is to increase due to rising ocean temperatures. Based upon recent electrical usage data we see that those warm months are the highest for electrical usage. The plant being forced to operate at reduction during the warm months coupled with the fact that those months are the highest in demand for energy show that a solution is necessary for the plant to remain at full operation."
