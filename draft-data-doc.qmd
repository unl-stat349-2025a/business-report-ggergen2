NERC collects, maintains, and annually publishes the Electricity Supply and Demand (ES&D) database, which includes 10-year projections for the North American bulk power system (BPS). Data are presented for each NERC Region (and subregions where applicable) for years 1990-2010. For years 2011 to present, data are presented for each NERC Assessment Area. Some information in the ES&D has been aggregated to protect sensitive information.
